## Description
This is an animation of *fire-blazing __wave__* moving horizontally across the screen.

This is a zig-zag style long wave which will fascinate you for sure as it passes through the screen. It _do not uses_ ```graphics.h``` and is purely loop based and time-controlled pattern.

## Compatibility
This C file uses substitute of ```gotoxy()``` for **gcc compiler** by using some functions of ```windows.h``` library which makes it compatible only on Windows.
For Linux and Mac OS X, please contribute the necessary changes.
